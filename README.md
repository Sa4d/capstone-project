The data is contained in three files:

- profile.json - demographic data for each customer
- transcript.json - records for transactions, offers received, offers viewed, and offers completed

# Libraries

- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- NumPy
- datetime


# Imporvements

so after I finished analyzing the data, I can notice there is some view missing data that could be useful to us, for example if we have the data of what kind of order did the customer buy and what kind of coffee and study the reasons behind why the customers like these products and do more offers with these products to increase sales.

# Conclusion

the following is my conclusion through the analysis that I did:

BOGO is the most offer type is liked by customers and closely to that comes the discounts offer
We Saw that most of the customers we have are males, we can see the historical data and see what they ordered and do more offers for what they liked.
the customers had good income number so we should do offers that will attract them to buy more
